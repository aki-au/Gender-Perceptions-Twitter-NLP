# Gender-Perceptions-Twitter-NLP
Gender inequality is a  phenomenon in which different genders are not treated equally. Studies show that different genders have different experiences across several domains including education, life expectancy, personality, interests, family life, careers, and political affiliation. With the advent of "Big Data" and "Data Science", we have enough data and tools at our disposal to answer existing questions about gender inequality from a new perspective. 

The aim of this project was to analyse how gender is perceived across the United States. There are several ways in which this can be analysed and several sources from which data can be obtained. We chose to collect Social Media data and in particular, data from Twitter.
